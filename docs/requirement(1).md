## Clients requirement

### Irrigation design

The client required both mist irrigations and drip irrigations. therefore, 2 pumps are used for 2 different irrigtions, with each channels 1 main line with 4 sub lines. The decision for irrigation is run by timer, and later monitor by water moisture sensor. The microprocessor should know when to irrigate and regulate the head needed from the amount of valve required to open, in order to minimise water loss. The activity log, moisture readings and controls can be read & write by phone or PC.

### Control interface

The client can choose to control manually or run automated.

1. Client can choose to control manually from PC, phone or by mechanically.
2. Automation is run by both timer at certain period and moist sensors to regulate moisture level in the soil.

### Budgets

The client expect the project not to exceed RM2000.

### Deliverables

The client expect the prototype to be complete within 3 months.
