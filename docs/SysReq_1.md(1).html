# System Requirements for IrriCon

## Objectives

  - Create a system (HW & SW) that irrigates plants in a garden that can later be scal up to be use on a farm. The detailed features are outlined below.

## Functionality

##@ 1. Multiple Watering Modes of Irrigation:

  - It must be able to have at l;east 2 modes of Irrigation

  - __Mist Irrigation__

    - Use a _high-pressure_ pump and nozzles to create a fine spray to water plants - 

  - __Drip Irrigation__

    - Use a _pump_ and pipes/hose to feed water directly into the soil to the plant roots, using multiple _Channels_

  - for both modes the _duration_ and the _schedule_ of the watering should be _user-definable_.

### 2. Multi-channel capable

  - a __Channel__ is defimed as a _Pump & Pipe_ combination used to deliver a _watering Mode_ to a particular collection of plants.

  - The System has the capability to manage and drive one or more _Channels_.

  - Each _Channel_ can be set to any one _Watering Mode_

### 3. schedule & Duration

  - For each _Channel_ , irregardless of _watering Mode_, the Duration and Schedule for watering can be set.

  - _Duration_ is defined the length of time for the watering, defined in seconds. 
    - Based on the volume of the pump, the _duration_ can also be calculated as the volume (liters) of water to be delivered for each watwerig session, calculated as follows:

        volume = _Duration_ X pump's flow rate


  - _Schedule_ is defined as the time of day for a watering _Duration_.


### 4. Feedback and Watering Mode:

  - Watering Mode may either be configured via a _schedule_ as defined above, or it may be activated by feedback from a _Soil Moisture_ sensor.

### 5. Dashboard and Control Interface

  - The System shall provide a Web-interface to enable the User to:

    - view the various System parameters:

      - The number of Operating Channels
      - The water Mode of each Channel
      - Watering Duration of each Watering Mode
      - Schedule of watering for each Channel

    - View Statistics

      - Amount of water delivered/Channel
      - Amount of fertilizer delivered (mixed with water)/Channel
      - Monitor Soil moisture

    - View Work Status

      - Which Channels have already completed
      - Which Channels are yet to start

    - Failure reporting
      - When pumps fail
      - when pipes are stuck
      - when moisture sensors are not working


### 6. Scalability

  - The System must be able to control at least 5 Channels

  - More Channels can be added to the System
    
    - Spceify what HW needs to be added, including pumps etc..
    - There should be minimal addtional SW work, hence the API

### 6. API (Application Programming Interface)

  - The System shall have an API to allow other sub-systems to be integrated into the system. This could be either in the:

    - Hardware and Functionality; e.g.
